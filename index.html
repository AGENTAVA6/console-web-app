     To set up the visual studio code we have to:
     <h3>1.download visual studio code </h3>
     <h3>2.create a folder named visual studio code </h3>
     <h3>3.go to visual studio code and press open folder then select visual studio code(folder that you had created before) </h3>
     <h3>4.create a folder inside your visual studio code folder in  which you can create the html file,css file,javascript file </h3>
     <h3>Visual studio code is an app in which we code.It is one of the most advanced coding app. Professional programers also code  in this app for creating games.It is a very good app for coding.We also have auto complete in this and if we are typing a variable then the options come for the variable.We also have extensions in it like beautify and live server which is used to test what code we have done.</h3>

        We first print the text in the console screen and then we print the text in the main screen to make things clear and not get confused we print it in the console screen by console.log ().Console screen is very useful to us as we can see what variables are being used in the code and lots of oyher things.

        var my_first="My first console project";
        console.log(my_first);
        var first_name="Avyakt ";
        var last_name="Agarwal";
        var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);
        var num_1=20;
        var num_2=10;
        var multiply=num_1*num_2;
        console.log(multiply);
        var divide=num_1/num_2;
        console.log(divide);
        var sub=num_1-num_2;
        console.log(sub);
        var add=num_2+num_1;
        console.log(add);
